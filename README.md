# Minecraft Classic Browser Textures
This repository contains all of the fonts, sounds, and textures used by the [browser version of Minecraft Classic](https://classic.minecraft.net/). By overriding the files in your browser, you could theoretically use this to make a texture pack for the game.

## Things to note
- The block previews are not generated from the block textures (i.e. overriding [dirt.png](assets/textures/dirt.png) will not change [3.png](assets/textures/previews/3.png)).
- [background.jpg](assets/textures/background.jpg) is only used when you access the website on mobile.
- [water.png](assets/textures/water.png) and [lava.png](assets/textures/lava.png) are only displayed when trying to place water and lava blocks, which is normally impossible. The actual water and lava textures are procedurally generated within the javacript code.
- [player.png](assets/textures/player.png) is unused.
- Because Mojang doesn't let you crawl their website, there are likely other unused textures not in this repository.
